Elbow angle acquisition with kinect sensor using Matlab

A Kinect sensor (Kinect for Windows, version 1, Microsoft) was used to
record the motions of the elbow. The angles in degrees were calculated from the
joint coordinates obtained by the skeleton tracked with the depth camera. During
the movements, only three joints were needed:

Figura: Angles resulting from the measurement. The skeleton of the upper extremities is
marked in the red line, while the study joint, is in the yellow line

beta angle (see Figure \ref{fig:figura1}). Measurements were acquired during the subjectâ€™s maximum flexion
and then a 90-degree approach.
